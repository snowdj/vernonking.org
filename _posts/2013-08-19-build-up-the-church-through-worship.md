*Composer*: William H. Doane

## Verse 1

Seek gifts of the spirit to benefit all
In what we are giv'n let's remember our call
To build up each other with prophetic words
Not speaking in languages no one has heard

## Refrain

Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord,
Let us be as one voice!
Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord,
Let Christ's Body rejoice!
Come worship the Father through Jesus the Son,
By the pow'r of the Spirit, our God, three-in-one

## Verse 2

Lifeless instruments can be played in a lurch
But isn't it better to build up the church?
Babbling benefits no one under the sun
Let's excel in building up God's church in love

### [Refrain]

## Verse 3

Let's be mature thinkers, but infants t'ward sin
For God uses tongues to judge those against him
But prophets are used to convict and disclose
All secrets of heart within God's former foes

### [Refrain]

## Verse 4

In conduct we must keep our order in mind
We should always speak only one at a time
Uplifting the church in love must be our means
To worship the Godhead who is Trinity

### [Refrain]
