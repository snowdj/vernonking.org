In a general sense, justification is showing something to be right. Theologically, justification is the declaration of one's righteousness before God. How can we expand this pithy definition of justification to more thoroughly understand this theological truth?

Because of Adam's original sin, all humans are born in a state of separation from right relationship with God. At conception, none are right with God, none have right standing before God, none are righteous, no not one. As ones born unrighteous, we all need to be justified in order to become righteous. Without the transformation of justification, we cannot become righteous before God.

As participants in the righteousness of God through Christ, we now have no condemnation. As Paul exclaims in Romans 8:33, "Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies" (ESV). We cannot be condemned before God because we have been made right before God through our justification. Justification radically alters our state from one of separation and condemnation to one of peace with God and right standing before him. 

Galatians 2:15ff. shows that we are justified by faith in Christ, not by works of the law. By grace we are given the gift of faith in order to be justified before God, to be seen by him as righteous individuals. Our justification comes by faith in Christ because he is the reconciliation of God as the incarnate God who came to unite man with God. The Son has forever been righteous with God, as God, and became man so that he might make sinners righteous as well. Only by the life, death, and resurrection of the perfect God-man is there any opportunity for justification before God. We are justified by faith in Christ because, by faith, we are able to participate in the righteousness of God.

However, justification by faith does not preclude the importance of works as a component of our righteousness. Jesus taught that on the Day of Judgment we will be justified or condemned by our words for "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" (Matthew 12:33--37 [ESV]). Furthermore, James taught that our works must show our faith; Abraham's faith was not fully exercised until he offered his son as a sacrifice. Indeed, "faith apart from works is dead" (James 5:14--26). Therefore, we are justified by grace through faith but must participate in works in order to exercise and complete our faith. However, this is not a justification by works alone because "by works of the law no human being will be justified" in the sight of God (Romans 3:20 [ESV]). We are only made right before God by his own act of justification

With the exercising of faith by works, we see that justification leads to sanctification. We who are made right before God are to conform to his will and image and thereby grow in godly works in light of our justification. These are the works of the law of faith that God prepared for us because we have been created in Christ Jesus. Justification necessarily precedes sanctification. Good works flow out of righteousness; good works do not make one righteous. However, Jesus Christ did the good work so that "one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men" (Rom. 5:18 [ESV]). 

The act of justification turns someone who has no right standing before God into one who is righteous in the sight of God. All men may be justified by God through faith in Christ Jesus, who by his good works shares his righteousness with mankind. God's work of justification allows us to participate in Jesus' right standing before the Father so that we may become the very righteousness of God.
