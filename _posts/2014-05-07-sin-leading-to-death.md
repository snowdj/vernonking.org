In Romans 5:12ff, the apostle Paul explains how we all have death in Adam but can have life in Jesus Christ. First, we know that “sin came into the world through one man,” Adam. Through the temptation of the serpent and Adam’s following of his wife into sin, Adam brought sin into the world---choosing sin when he had the providence and grace from God to not sin. “And death through sin”: Adam’s sin led to his own death both spiritually and physically.

Through the story of Genesis 3, we know that there are two types of death, physical and spiritual—spiritual death leads to physical death. The result of sin is spiritual death and separation from God’s protection, which brings physical death. Paul continues in Romans 5:12, "so death spread to all men because all sinned." Is the death of all men a result of their own sin, or the sin of Adam? In verses 15 and 17, Paul writes, “many died through one man’s tresspass . . . because of one man’s trespass, death reigned through that one man.” This language appears to show that through the sin of Adam, all of humanity became subject to death. Adam’s sin separated him and his offspring from the goodness of the full providence of God, including protection from physical death.

Sin and death have spread to all men because Adam sinned and died. Regardless of human deed, no child of Adam has the ability within himself to restore right relationship with God; Adam broke relationship on account of all humanity. Without this right relationship, all men are spiritually and physically corrupt and will succumb to death and decay.

However, the original sin of Adam (the consequence of which we all inherit) does not entail original guilt passed down from generation to generation. All are guilty by their own deeds. In fact, if guilt were passed down through humanity, then Jesus would have needed to be something other than truly human in order to be guilty of no sin. Therefore, from Adam we all inherit a corrupt humanity, but not the guilt of sin. However, we all sin and succumb to death. While our sorry state is the consequence of Adam's sin, our own sin cannot be blamed on our first father.

Without Adam's sin and death, sin and death would not reign in this world. While we are responsible for our own sin, Adam is responsible for the introduction of sin and the consequence of death. However, in the same way Adam brought sin and death into the world, Jesus brought life. Through the life of the one man Jesus we may receive the abundance of grace. Adam's one trespass led to condemnation for all men; Jesus' act of righteousness leads to life for all men.
