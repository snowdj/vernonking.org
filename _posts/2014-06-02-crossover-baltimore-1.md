Today followed the standard format for this upcoming week: breakfast on campus, time in the lecture hall, lunch on campus, work with churches, then a free evening. During breakfast it was clear that the summer cafeteria staff was ill-prepared to serve ~200 hungry and caffeine-addicted Baptists. From overhearing the staff, it was clear that they had no knowledge of the impending influx we caused. However, I was glad to hear no complaining from the seminary students and staff---only kind and affirming words. Overall, our host university has been serving us well and we are greatful for their service.

In the lecture hall, we heard from Michael Crawford, a pastor from the church my team is serving. After telling his own story of redemption and eventual ministry, he offered many encouraging (and [tweet-able](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sebaltimore)) words to the group. For instance, he described his own conversion as resulting in a combination of no longing wanting what he used to want and wanting that which he didn't yet understand. Furthermore, he advised future church planters to "Plant yourself, plant your family, plant the gospel, and see a church planted knowing that you didn't do it."

In the afternoon, my team spent a majority of its time discussing the life and vision of Freedom Baptist Church before taking a couple of hours to promote a hosted block party this Friday. My team of nine drove out to a nearby shopping center and passed out flyers promoting the event. We found great success in requesting the businesses to distribute and promote the fliers on our behalf. Many stores were eager to use this opportunity to participate in the local community. All in all, we did not have any gospel conversations because of the nature of the distribution. The team is looking forward to going house-to-house tomorrow evening, Lord-willing.
