When a Protestant hears Mary referred to as the “Mother of God”, he might immediately think of the veneration (or even worship) of Mary. While most who use the term “Mother of God” would insist they do not worship Mary, one must consider whether the title is appropriate to describe a mere mortal. For such an endeavor, one ought to turn first to Scripture for an analysis of Mary and her role as mother.

Luke offers much narrative about Mary’s experience during her announcement, conception, and pregnancy of our Lord Jesus Christ. The angel who announced to Mary her coming miraculous pregnancy addressed her, saying, “O favored one, the Lord is with you!” (Luke 1:28 [ESV]). Later, Mary’s relative, Elizabeth, being filled with the Holy Spirit, cried out in greeting, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!” (Luke 1:42) In the same breath, Elizabeth even calls Mary “the mother of my Lord” (Luke 1:43). Finally, in her *Magnificat*, Mary exults that “all generations will call me blessed” (Luke 1:48).

Such descriptions of Mary’s blessedness show that Mary is counted as blessed on account of her son, Jesus. Indeed, Simeon blessed the family because of “this child” (Luke 2:34) and the wise men “saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped *him*” (Matt. 2:11 [ESV], emphasis added). Despite such pronouncements of Mary’s blessedness, Jesus appears to minimize his mother’s role in his adult life. Even when his mother and brothers were trying to approach him, Jesus taught his disciples, “My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it” (Luke 8:21). The author of Hebrews even emphasizes that Melchizedek, like Jesus, “is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life” (Heb. 7:3). However, one must recognize Jesus did not totally disregard his mother, e.g., he made sure to assign John to her care as he himself hung on the cross (John 19:25). 

One can deduce that Mary was exceedingly blessed to bear and care for Jesus, but was not special by her own right. Although the messenger angel called her “favored one”, Scripture remains silent as to why God chose Mary to mother Jesus. Indeed, along with the rest of Jesus’ family, Mary is perhaps depicted in the Gospels as doubting Jesus’ role as Messiah (Mark 3:21). Therefore, one must ask, “Does Mary merit special veneration?” The Scriptural depiction of Mary shows that all generations ought to consider her blessed, but only on account of Jesus the Messiah.

Is is appropriate to call Mary the “Mother of God”? Succinctly, the answer must be no. To call Mary the “Mother of God” brings in multiple errors. First it connotes that Mary is greater than God and the source of God. Second, it promotes a misconception of the Trinity by reducing God to Jesus alone. Calling Mary the “Mother of God” implies that she is the mother of the Triune God, an implication that is both scripturally and logically false. Perhaps Luke most aptly titles Mary as “the mother of Jesus” (Acts 1:14 [ESV]) because Mary is, quite accurately, the earthly mother of Jesus Christ, the Son of God---a high honor indeed.

As Mary’s *Magnificat* asserts, “generations will call me blessed *for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name*” (Luke 1:48–49 [ESV], emphasis added). Mary is certainly blessed among women, but it is because of the fruit of her womb, by whom mercy is extended “from generation to generation” (Luke 1:50 [ESV]). Praise God for the fruit of Mary’s womb!
