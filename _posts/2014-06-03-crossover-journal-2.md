This morning we received a lesson-sermon from Preston Nix, Professor of Evangelism and Preaching at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. (Notably, this professor shares my hometown of Waco, TX.) Dr. Nix provided many words of encouragement toward evangelism and did a stellar job at keeping most of us awake (inside joke). He primarily wanted us to learn to be consistently *intentional* in evangelism using a three-fold method: (1) Connect with people, (2) Communicate the Gospel, and (3) Call for a Response.

Joel Kurz, a local pastor at a young church, also spoke this morning, giving us another perspective of life and ministry in Baltimore. His congregation is located in one of the poorer neighborhoods in the area, doing great work at bringing the message of reconciliation to all types of men and women. Joel offered wisdom learned from both his successes and mistakes and freely confessed his own failings.

Today (and for the rest of the week), our team will break out of the default schedule and have free time in the afternoon while ministering in the evening. For lunch, our local church pastor took us to a hole in the wall restaurant, [The Real Thing](http://therealthingtowson.com), serving "The Best Cheesesteak in Baltimore." It was great. Our team then drove downtown and enjoyed some of the sights of the [Baltimore Harbor](http://baltimore.org/article/baltimore-inner-harbor). 

At 17:00, we made our way back to our local church in order to help sweep a major area of their neighborhood with block party invitations with the hope of gospel conversations. For a while, I approached each door by myself; however, almost no one was answering. However, after regrouping, I joined my teammate, Michelle, and I found much more success in people opening their doors. 

One lady, Carolyn, ended up speaking to us for a while. We quickly discovered that she was still grieving the loss of her mother from 13 months prior and had some difficult surgeries scheduled soon. Notably, Carolyn had been moved by a Christmas Cactus given by our local church months before. When she realized we were representing the same church, she discussed at length the comfort she received from the gift and the kindness expressed by the giver; this was back at a time when she was deeply grieving her mother. She is a member of a local Catholic Church and we were able to encourage her in the gospel, in the hope of Christ and his return, and in the comfort provided by the Spirit and the Church. After Carolyn spent many tears while sharing with us, Michelle prayed with her before we departed.

My body is tired but my soul is glad. Much work is being done in the name of the Lord this week. We pray that the Lord will produce fruit in Baltimore.
