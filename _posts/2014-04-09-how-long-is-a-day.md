The creation narrative in Genesis 1 poetically flows from section to section with the statement, "And there was evening and there was morning, the [X]th day." For six days, God spoke and created the world out of nothing, until "on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested" (Gen. 2:2). With such focus on each day of creation, one may be inclined to wonder how to interpret "day" in Genesis 1. Does "day" represent a 24-hour calendar-day, an epoch of time, or is the entire passage poetic with no direct correlation to history? More important for Christian theology, however, is whether or not it is necessary to affirm a certain interpretation of the creation account in Genesis 1--2.

One interpretation of Genesis 1 relies upon a literalistic reading of the text. This view interprets the "evening" and "morning" of the text to signify standard calendar-days. While some have additionally interpreted the creation account to be prophetic, most of the Church for centuries has promoted the literalistic interpretation of a calendar-day view of "day". Generally, the calendar-day theory aligns with a view of the earth as being "young", that is, thousands of years old.

Despite the historical acceptance of the calendar-day view, many theologians have looked to other interpretations of the creation narrative in light of the scientific community's consensus of natural history. Looking to scientific evidence, many Christians now read the creation account with the presumption that the earth is very old. Theories abound to explain the proper interpretation of this text in light of the scientific evidence; there are too many to enumerate here. However, the most significant theological distinction between various old-earth views lies in the ascription of credit for creation: some credit God fully for creation while others only credit God partially in light of Darwinism, evolution, and natural selection. As we will see, that line is primarily what will distinguish acceptable Christian interpretations and unchristian interpretations.

In order to be Christian, theologians must affirm the veracity of the text of Scripture. Unfortunately, this does not limit many of our options. Most of the Christian debate regarding this text lies not in rejecting its truthfulness, but in properly interpreting its meaning. That is, confessing Christians may provide a wide variety of interpretations of Genesis 1--2, while still affirming the authority and infallibility of the text of Scripture. 

However, a Christian view of creation must affirm certain truths that are clear in the text and reaffirmed throughout Scripture. First, Christians must affirm, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth" (Gen. 1:1); any view denying God's activity in creation is unchristian. Second, a Christian interpretation of the creation account must affirm that what God made in the account was "good" before the fall. Third, a Christian view of creation must affirm the special creation of man; Adam and Eve were real people, the first humans, created specially by God. Christian soteriology demands that every human (including Jesus) is a descendant of Adam, who is responsible for original sin and the fall. 

When approaching the narrative of creation, we Christians must be careful to interpret Scripture in light of Scripture before attempting to interpret Scripture in light of science. Furthermore, we must hold to the veracity of our text over any claim by science or natural history. However, we Christians must all be generous to one another as we wrestle together to properly interpret the creation narrative of Genesis 1--2. God has told us through Scripture all that we need to know about creation for the purpose of salvation. May we all rest in the gospel story that begins at creation.
