At the Incarnation, the Word became flesh---the Son of God became man. Jesus, who is the Incarnate Son of God, is one person with two natures. He is fully God and fully man. No attribute of his divinity is diminished and no attribute of his humanity is diminished. Indeed, Jesus is both fully human and the true human; he is humanity as we were meant to be.

The hypostatic union within the Incarnation is a great mystery to our finite minds. The Son of God became a man; however, he remained as God. He did not remove a cloak of divinity and take on a cloak of humanity. He did not select a pre-existing human for adoption. He did not come merely in the appearance of a man. Rather, the Son of God remained God while also becoming a man. Two natures, both divine and human, are united within one person, Jesus Christ. This reality took place at the Incarnation.

God became human. Therefore, Jesus possesses all of the attributes of human beings. The attributes of humanity are limiting in comparison to the attributes of divinity. However, Jesus, as the God-man, possesses both the human and divine natures, and possesses both the human and divine attributes. While God is omnipresent, man is spatially and temporally circumscribed. The Son of God lives a genuine, valid human life in all ways.  The Son humiliates himself into living a human life in order to reconcile us to himself.

The Son of God takes on humanity, adding to himself. The one who is incapable of dying chooses to take on humanity, which can die. All of the actions and experiences of Jesus belong to the Son of God. Therefore, the Son of God experienced a human death, but not a divine death. The properties of human and divine do not cross over each other, but they are united in the Son. In the *communicatio idiomatum*, the Son takes up the  properties that he needs at a given time. When he rides in a boat, he's acting with a human property. When he forgives, he's acting with a divine property. He uses attributes as is fitting for the given context. The one person acts with attributes of his two natures, as fits the occasion. 

According to the Council of Chalcedon, the two natures of Jesus are united in four ways. (1) Jesus's two natures are united without confusion: they do not make a *tertium quid* and there is no jumbling of his attributes. (2) Jesus' two natures are united without mixture: he is both God and man. (3) Jesus' two natures are united without diminishing: he has full access to every attribute of each nature. (4) Jesus' two natures are united with separating: they are united and cannot be separated.

In this way, the Son adds new sets of properties to himself in becoming human. The Son is self-limiting in the life of Jesus. Jesus sheds blood in sweat because he is subjecting his human will to his divine will. The Son's divine will is already perfectly aligned with the Father's will, but he must conform his human will to his divine will. 

The person of Jesus is the Son of God Incarnate. The Son does and experiences all things in the life of Jesus. The person of Christ and the work of Christ are inseparable from each other. The divine and human attributes are shared by one person, Jesus. The one who is incapable of dying takes on the ability to die. The Son makes this descent for the salvation of men. Jesus uses the different attributes of his two natures as is appropriate for his work of salvation for mankind.
