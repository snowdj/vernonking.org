*The Master Plan of Evangelism*. By Robert E. Coleman. 2nd Ed. Abridged. Grand Rapids: Revell, 2010, 154 pp., $5.12 Kindle. Reviewed by Vernon R. King, III.

# Summary

Robert Coleman’s *The Master Plan of Evangelism* is a little book that has made a significant impact in the field of evangelism since its first publication in 1963. Within this text, Coleman uses Jesus’ ministry as a model for personal evangelism and discipleship. Although he often interjects his own suppositions for Jesus’ strategy, Coleman helpfully systematizes Jesus’ approach as described in the Gospels.

The author reduces Jesus’ "master plan of evangelism" into eight interdependent components that Christians and the church today can emulate:

1.	*Selection*. Jesus selected his disciples, concentrating on the few men willing to learn, while not neglecting the masses. 
2.	*Association*. Jesus associated with his disciples, teaching them through a shared life experience. 
3.	*Consecration*. Jesus expected obedience from his disciples, counting the cost of discipleship, so that they could know the truth and do it. 
4.	*Impartation*. Jesus gave up himself for the sake of his disciples. 
5.	*Demonstration*. Jesus showed his disciples how to live by his commands through prayer, Scripture, and natural teaching. 
6.	*Delegation*. Jesus assigned tasks to the disciples so they could "put into practice what they had seen their Master do" (p. 80). 
7.	*Supervision*. Jesus supervised his disciples’ growth through questions and observation and continued to teach them in light of their experience.
8.	*Reproduction*. Jesus expected his disciples to make their own disciples, following his methodology.

# Contribution to Evangelism in the Local Church

Outside the helpful strategy that Coleman provides, his greatest contribution to local church evangelism is his emphasis on including discipleship as a component of evangelism. Even though Coleman wrote this book a generation ago, local churches still struggle with counting converts prior to making disciples. Therefore, the author rightly critiques churches for participating in attractional evangelism without proper personal intervention. He insists such practice will provide "false security, and … may ultimately do more harm than good" if no one "will fill the gap in a real way" (p. 47). He even attributes the falling away of many converts to the church’s failure to personally follow-up for the long-term. In light of this failure, Coleman argues, "It is high time that the requirements for membership in the church be interpreted and enforced in terms of true Christian discipleship" (p. 59).

Despite its age, Coleman’s work continues to make significant contributions to evangelism in the local church today. This book has been perhaps the most influential contribution to evangelistic studies in the past half-century. *The Master Plan of Evangelism* continues to be recommended by authors and evangelists because of its impact in the field; its popularity helps to ensure that its contributions to evangelism are realized within local churches.

# Author’s Argumentation

Coleman argued each of his eight components of evangelism by walking through the example of Jesus, extracting a principle, and applying the principle for the local church. Unfortunately, Coleman’s interpretation of Jesus’ ministry is found lacking at times. For instance, the author consistently imposes thoughts and motivations upon Jesus based on his actions, e.g., "[Jesus] knew that they could master these defects as they grew in grace and knowledge" (p. 55). Furthermore, Coleman often emphasized Jesus’ humanity at the expense of his divinity. Finally, the author sometimes fell prey to hyperbole and the poor use of statistics, e.g., "[Jesus] actually spent more time with his disciples than with everybody else in the world put together" (p. 42) and "there are actually more unevangelized people on the earth today than before the invention of the horseless carriage" (p. 34). 

Despite the problems sometimes found in Coleman’s interpretation, his application is consistently appropriate and applicable for the church today. The author rightly addresses the areas in which the church (still) consistently fails in evangelism and discipleship while providing helpful, implementable correctives. Coleman’s most helpful contributions come through his "Principle in Focus" and "Principle Applied Today" sections in each chapter.

# Key Quotes

> When it is all boiled down, those of us who are seeking to train people must be prepared to have them follow us, even as we follow Christ (1 Cor. 11: 1). We are the exhibit (Phil. 3: 17f.; 1 Thess. 2: 7, 8; 2 Tim. 1: 13). They will do those things that they hear and see in us (Phil. 4: 9). Given time, it is possible through this kind of leadership to impart our way of living to those who are constantly with us. We must take this truth to our lives. There can be no shirking or evading of our personal responsibility to show the way to those we are training, and this revelation must include the practical outworking in life of the deeper realities of the Spirit. (pp. 77–78).

> [Jesus’] whole evangelistic strategy—indeed, the fulfillment of his very purpose in coming into the world, dying on the cross, and rising from the grave—depended on the faithfulness of his chosen disciples to this task. It did not matter how small the group was to start with so long as they reproduced and taught their disciples to reproduce. This was the way his church was to win—through the dedicated lives of those who knew the Savior so well that his Spirit and method constrained them to tell others. As simple as it may seem, this was the way the gospel would conquer. (p. 102)
