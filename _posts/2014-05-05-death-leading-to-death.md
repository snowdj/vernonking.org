When Adam and Eve were in the good garden, God commanded them to not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, lest they die. However, when tempting her to eat of the fruit, the serpent told Eve, "You will not surely die." When Eve (and Adam) succumbed to temptation and ate of the fruit, they did not immediately fall over and die. Was the serpent right? Adam and Eve did not physically die in the garden that day---no, they died in the wilderness hundreds of years later.

Adam and Eve died that day in the garden; they died spiritually when they sinned and ate of the fruit. Eating the fruit of the tree brought spiritual death to Adam and Eve because they were no longer in right communion with God; they no longer expressed faith and trust in him and his provision. By rejecting God through sin, Adam and Eve chose to trust themselves and adjudicate what is proper and good. By no longer trusting God, Adam and Eve separated themselves from what was truly good and became subject to the (bad) wilderness. Through sin, they left the goodness of God and his work and chose to experience the separation from that perfect goodness. They left right fellowship with God in an attempt to become like him and obtain the knowledge of good and evil. 

Adam and Eve were instructed to work and keep the garden, to worship and obey God. They were called to tend the garden and trust God for life and nourishment. The first man and woman were given a life of innocence from sin and ignorance of evil. Adam and his wife had a will, but had no sin until they chose to disobey God's providential instruction. However, by the temptation of the serpent, Adam and Eve chose to distrust God and attempt to make themselves like him by attaining the knowledge of good and evil. Alas, in order to attain that knowledge, Adam and Eve broke God's commandment, and both good and evil. Through the intent and action of sin, they brought upon themselves spiritual death---as warned by God. The serpent *lied* to the first humans when he said they would not die; he fooled them into joining him in separation from the great goodness of God.

Their spiritual deaths, however, was more significant than their physical deaths; the spiritual death led to the physical death. Both types of death were rooted in the willful decision of Adam and Eve to sin against the creator God. Furthermore, spiritual death led to physical death because Adam and Eve were no longer protected by the covering of God. Without this protection, the original man and woman became subject to their own mortality, to physical death and destruction. Adam was made of the dust, and because of his sin, was cursed to return to the dust in physical death. 

Through sin, Adam and Eve brought both spiritual and physical death upon themselves and into all of humanity. They turned from God's grace and protection and chose to live a life outside of his goodness. Through this sin, our first parents gave us an inheritance of physical corruption (physical death) and a nature inclined to sin (leading to spiritual death).
