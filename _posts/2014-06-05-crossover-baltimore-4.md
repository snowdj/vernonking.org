Brandon Kiesling, a PhD student at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, spoke this morning on a biblical philosophy of evangelism. This guy was fired up. He introduced himself with his own testimony of being a former meth addict, maker, and dealer. However, he was saved by grace through faith after a judge extended him mercy when he was otherwise facing 15 years. The power of the message of the gospel changes dealers into disciples! Following his testimony, Brandon went through Matt Queen's [eight questions](http://pastors.com/8-questions-to-assess-your-evangelism/) for a biblical philosophy of evangelism. 

Following, Robert Anderson, a veteran pastor with 18 years of experience in Baltimore, spoke about his church and ministry. When asked to give advice for our class, Robert immediately gave three tips for seminarians: (1) get to know the Holy Spirit, (2) make the church into the image of Christ, not the image of you, and (3) persist in the faithful preaching of the Word of God.

In a change of pace, Michael Crawford of Freedom Church returned for an extended Q&A regarding some of his topics from Monday. His first main emphasis regarded planting a church well by first planting yourself, your family, and the gospel. His second emphasis was on living a sustainable life with a sustainable ministry so that you can persevere to the end and not burn out.

In the evening, our team again went door-to-door advertising for Freedom Church a neighborhood party scheduled for Friday while also seeking out gospel conversations. Today my parter was Andrea. In one of our first houses, we spoke with a lady who was kind and gracious, but also needed to leave soon. When Andrea asked her if she was part of a church anywhere, she responded, "I've never been part of a church, but I would love to start!" We were blown away by both her candor and eager desire to discover church. Although she had to leave, she was eager to receive The Story and expressed her intention of attending the party on Friday and possibly church on Sunday.

Soon after, Andrea and I spoke with young lady who, with her kids, had just moved back into her mom's house. She had a church background and quickly confessed to be a Christian but had no church home after the move. Because our time was short with her as well (her kids were playing in the back yard), we invited her to Freedom Church and she seemed receptive.

After those two conversations, Andrea and I did not find any more receptive individuals the rest of the night. Many doors went unopened (often with people at home). One of the last people to answer a door for us was an older lady. After inviting her to the neighborhood party she responded, "I'd love to put on my dancing shoes, but I'm home on hospice." The pain in her pain and voice was evident, although she did not desire to speak for long. Thankfully, she professed Christ and claimed that her Presbyterian church had been taking good care of her in her final days. 

Afterward, our team had a (very) late dinner at Abbey's Burger Bistro downtown.
