# Introduction

Polity is an important topic for every church, but especially so for autonomous local churches which must consider all issues for themselves under the headship of Christ and the authority of Scripture. In recent years, there has been an increase in the discussion of polity within Baptist circles, especially regarding elders and deacons.[^I-1a] While there has been an appropriate focus on the need for multiple male elders and a service-oriented diaconate, less attention has been paid to the biblical role of women in service ministry. This paper aims to demonstrate the biblical expectation for women to participate within a servant-ministry office in the local church, specifically, the diaconate. Much attention will be given to the "women" referenced in 1 Timothy 3:11, while further context will be established by early church history, Romans 16:1, and Philippians 1:1.

## Polity Assumptions

This paper makes certain assumptions concerning church polity, including congregationalism, local church autonomy, and a complementarian view of male elders. Most importantly, this paper assumes that the diaconate is a non-authoritative servant-ministry office within the church, which allows the following discussion to proceed while steering clear of concerns of the possibility of women in authoritative roles. William Mounce agrees, whatever role women may take in the diaconate, "it is not related to the issue of women in leadership since the deacon(ess) does not provide authoritative leadership."[^I-2-1a]

[^I-2-1a]: William D. Mounce, *Pastoral Epistles*, Word Biblical Commentary, vol. 46 (Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers, 2000), 202. Note well, Mounce does not affirm female deacons. Robert Utley also sees the problem clearly, "The problem in our day is that we have made deacons an executive board which, because of other passages in Timothy, seem to rule out women. However, deacons are meant to be servants, and therefore, women have an appropriate role" (Robert James Utley, *Paul’s Fourth Missionary Journey*, Study Guide Commentary Series, (Marshall, TX: Bible Lessons International, 2000), 47).

# Historiography

Historical evidence shows the early church had women in various servant ministry positions. Clement of Alexandria wrote of "ministering women," or "women deacons"[^H-1b] and John Chrysostom interpreted Paul as writing about "deaconesses."[^H-1c] Deaconesses ministered only to women; their responsibilities included administering baptism, instructing catechumens, and caring for the ill.[^H-1d] A deaconess ministered only to women because "for a deaconess of the early church to teach a man or to nurse him in sickness would have been an impossibility."[^H-1e] The ordination of women for servant-ministry began to fall out of favor in the West with the Council of Laodicea (363--364 AD). Eventually, the First Council of Orange (441 AD) ruled that no future deaconesses were to be ordained, "on account of the weakness of the sex."[^H-1f]

[^H-1d]: Interestingly, the early female servant roles often included a vow of chastity (George T. Montague, *First and Second Timothy, Titus*, Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture, (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2008), 82). Also, "The Apostolical Constitutions (vi. 17) say that she must be a chaste virgin ... or else a widow." (Henry R. Percival, "Excursus on the Deaconess of the Early Church," in *The Seven Ecumenical Councils*, 41-42, *Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Second Series* 14, ed. Philip Schaff and Henry Wace (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1999), 41).

Although William Mounce does not endorse a female diaconate, he considers it "helpful to look at the evidence from the early church for a description of this developing function."[^H-2a] After reviewing the historiography, M. V. Pereira agrees, "The preponderance of evidence powerfully testifies to the historical certainty that women served as deacons, in various capacities, from the earliest of church history---to this there can be no dispute."[^H-2b] Indeed, the International Theological Commission determined: 

> [A] ministry of deaconesses did indeed exist, and … developed unevenly in the different parts of the Church. It seems clear that this ministry was not perceived as simply the feminine equivalent of the masculine diaconate. At the very least it was an ecclesial function, exercised by women, sometimes mentioned together with that of subdeacon in the lists of Church ministries.[^H-2c]

History shows that the early church’s interpretation of Scripture called for women to officially serve in certain ministry positions, primarily as deaconesses. The role of women in servant ministry is thus not a new debate, nor is the debate a result of the egalitarian movement. However, as Pereira wrote, the historical practice of the church "must not… be confused with biblical exegesis… the final answer to the question at hand rests on the biblical data."[^H-3a]

# Women in 1 Timothy 3:11

First Timothy 3:1--13 is an ad-hoc list of qualifications for Christian offices. The offices that are clearly in view are the elder[^W-1b] and deacon. However, within the qualifications for deacons is a peculiar verse, "In the same way, the women are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything" (1 Tim. 3:11 [NIV]).[^W-1c] The difficulty of this verse centers on one question: Who are the women in view? A common interpretation is that the "women" are the wives of deacons. However, the majority view among commentators is that the "women" are part of a certain diaconal church office (although there is further debate as to the name and nature of this office). Philip Towner comments (accurately, it seems), "It is difficult to be certain which meaning Paul intended."[^W-1a] For this reason, much time will be spent answering this one question about 1 Timothy 3:11.

[^W-1b]: This author views overseer, elder, and pastor as synonymous and will use "elder" throughout as a matter of preference, even though "overseer" is the term used in 1 Timothy 3:2. This does not affect the points below.

[^W-1a]: Philip H. Towner, *1--2 Timothy & Titus*, IVP New Testament Commentary Series, (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity, 1994), 91. Towner apparently solidified his position as he later introduces this verse writing, "Verse 11 abruptly introduces women deacons ... as being on an equivalent basis with deacons in general, after which verse 12 returns to a final consideration of male deacons" (Philip H. Towner, *The Letters to Timothy and Titus*, New International Commentary on the New Testament (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans, 2006), 260).

[^W-1c]: Unless otherwise specified, all Scripture references are from the NIV.

For ease of reference, 1 Timothy 3:8--12 reads:

> (8) In the same way, deacons are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. (9) They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. (10) They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons. (11) In the same way, the women are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything. (12) A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well.

## Wives of Deacons

William Mounce and George Knight both advocate for the minority interpretation of "women" as "wives of deacons."[^W-1-1a] In support of this reading, they offer three arguments worth considering: (1) verse 11 should be read within the context of verse 12 and is therefore part of the male diaconate qualification. (2) This verse lacks the detail expected in a qualification for a church office. (3) Finally, this short list forgoes any fidelity requirement, as exists in all other qualifying lists. While these concerns are valid, further consideration will show that none demonstrate the necessary weight for the interpretation of "women" as "wives of deacons."

[^W-1-1a]: Mounce, 195. George W. Knight, III, *The Pastoral Epistles*, New International Greek Testament Commentary (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans, 1992), 171. Perhaps Liefeld's mixed reading should be included as well, but he affirms the role of women in the diaconate in ways Mounce and Knight decidedly do not (Walter L. Liefeld, *1 & 2 Timothy, Titus*, The NIV Application Commentary (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1999), 134, 138).

Paul’s discussion of the diaconate begins with 1 Timothy 3:8--10, introduces women in verse 11, and returns to married male deacons in verse 12. Mounce assumes verses 8--10 are directed only at men and therefore argues, "It would be awkward to discuss deacons in verses 8--10, switch to a different topic in verse 11, and then return to deacons in verses 12--13 without a textual clue that the topic has changed. This suggests the topic has not changed."[^W-1--2a] Mounce then interprets verses 11--12 as part of "the common theme of the deacon’s family," writing, "his wife must be blameless; he must be faithful in marriage; his children must be well-managed. These verses are thus dealing with the same topic and belong together."[^W-1--2b] While Mounce’s argument concerning the lack of "a textual clue that the topic has changed," is both well made and unproblematic, it is possible that Paul maintained the topic of deacon while changing the gender in view.[^W-1--2c] Also, the argument that verse 11 belongs to the "common theme of the deacon’s family" falters when one considers the lack of any corresponding requirement for elders’ wives. This problem will be discussed in depth in a following section.

[^W-1--2a]: Mounce, 203.

[^W-1--2b]: Ibid.

[^W-1--2c]: This could be Paul switching from addressing male deacons to female deacons, or it could be a switch from all deacons to female deacons. Most commentators affirm the former option.

Both Mounce and Knight argue that verse 11 has deacon’s wives in view because this list lacks a qualification concerning marital fidelity. This is striking to Mounce because, "in all three lists" in 1 Timothy (concerning elders, deacons, and widows), "Paul raises the issue of marital fidelity."[^W-1-4a] Moving the argument forward, Knight contends, "the omission can, however, be explained if the requirement is inherent in their position as wives of the [deacons]."[^W-1-4c] Knight argues that Paul assumes the fidelity of these women because they themselves are the wives to whom the deacons are faithful. However, this does not satisfactorily resolve the "missing" qualification, because the husband’s would not necessarily secure the wife’s fidelity. A fidelity qualification is simply not present for the women in verse 11, and its absence cannot be explained away by looking to the fidelity of the husband. Even so, Knight believes that wives of deacons serve unofficially as assistants to their husbands in the diaconate ministry.[^W-1-4b] This proves problematic, however, because even if the women in view are the wives of deacons, it is presumptive to declare the female role within the diaconate as unofficial. This ad-hoc list of requirements could be "missing" a fidelity requirement for a number of valid reasons, however, speculations abound because the text presents no apparent reason for the lack of this requirement.[^W-1-4d]

[^W-1-4a]: Mounce, 203. Knight, *The Pastoral Epistles*, 171.

[^W-1-4c]: Knight, *The Pastoral Epistles*, 171.

[^W-1-4b]: Ibid.

[^W-1-4d]: Another option is to assume the "women" are part of the "widows" group described in 1 Timothy 5, or possibly virgins. While this could remove Paul's need to re-address fidelity, the hermeneutical leap required is unwarranted. Cf. Utley, 47.

I. Howard Marshall articulates another argument for "wives of deacons" when he writes, "The fact that the qualifications concerning ‘women’ are placed in the midst of the deacon code, instead of on their own, and the cursory nature of the qualifications and the lack of detail do not suggest that something so important as a church office is in mind."[^W-1-3a] Similarly, Mounce argues, "The requirements, if for a female deacon, are considerably lighter than for a male deacon, and this seems unlikely."[^W-1-3b] However, Mounce concedes that his argument is invalid if verses 8--11 and 13 apply to both male and female deacons.[^W-1-3c] Even though this is a short list, Knight insists the "women" in view are too distinguished from the diaconate to be explicitly part of it.[^W-1-3d] Despite the acknowledged brevity of the female list, Knight argues, "The qualifications for deacon’s wives, who are engaged with the deacons in diaconal service, are virtually synonymous with the qualifications of the [diaconate]."[^W-1-3e] Under this view, the diaconate qualifications are fairly short as well, only adding the qualities of holding to the faith, being faithful to his wife, and managing his household well (vv. 9, 12). When compared to the fifteen qualities of an elder, the seven qualities for a deacon seem short indeed. However, this author found no argument that the office of deacon should be diminished simply because the qualities listed by Paul number less than half of those he lists for elders. In light of this comparison, it seems presumptive to ignore the possibility that Paul had an office in mind for the women in view simply based on the number of qualities listed in verse 11. It seems more likely that Paul lacks detail here because he was simply qualifying female candidates within the already-defined office of deacon.

## Deaconesses

The majority interpretation of "women" in 1 Timothy 3:11 allows women to serve in official positions within the diaconate ministry of the church.[^W-2-1a] The office in view is itself debated, with three views being predominant, (1) one office comprised of both men and women, (2) a distinct office of "deaconess," and (3) a lower office for female "deacon assistants."[^W-2-1b]  Following, it will be argued that the "women" in 1 Timothy 3:11 ought to be interpreted as "female deacons," equal members in the one gender-neutral office of deacon. The following arguments will be considered in support of this decision: (1) there was no feminine form of "deacon" at the time of the epistle; (2) "women" has no possessor in the text; (3) verse 11 may be a repetition of a feminine form of verse 8; (4) there is no qualification for "wives of elders"; and (5) the grammatical structure of 1 Timothy 3:1--13 places "women" under the category of "deacons."

It is worth noting that Paul did not have access to a feminine form of the term deacon when he was writing this epistle; the term for "deaconess" was coined later.[^W-2-1c] In light of this missing vocabulary, Liefeld grants that the diaconate is not necessarily a male-only position.[^W-2-1f] More concretely, Marshall suggests, "in lieu of this [feminine form], a generic reference to ‘women’ in the context of a discussion of deacons would be sufficient to indicate female deacons."[^W-2-1d] Perhaps Towner put it best: "While [women] seems too common a term to describe an office… a reference to ‘women’ would have sufficed to direct attention to female candidates for the post."[^W-2-1e] Indeed, the fact that Paul uses the term "women" and not some other official title strongly suggests that he has female deacons in view, not a third female-only office.

[^W-2-1a]: Mounce, 203.

[^W-2-1f]: Liefeld, 133.

[^W-2-1d]: Marshall, 493.

[^W-2-1e]: Towner, *The Letters to Timothy and Titus*, 266.

Furthermore, Paul’s use of "women" includes no possessive form, which would be expected if he were speaking of "deacon’s wives."[^W-2-2a] George Knight is unconvinced by this lack of a possessive relationship, writing, "In the whole pericope Paul refers to people anarthrously."[^W-2-2c] However, his examples include anarthrous uses of the genitive case in ways that clearly indicate possession, directly undercutting his argument. Indeed, according to I. Howard Marshall, "If ‘wives’ were meant, it would be normal to indicate this with a possessive pronoun or the definite article."[^W-2-2b] With no possessive pronoun, definite article, or genitive case, the simple reading of "women" in 1 Timothy 3:11 should not be interpreted as "wives of deacons."

[^W-2-2a]: Montague, 82.

[^W-2-2b]: Marshall, 493.

[^W-2-2c]: Knight, *The Pastoral Epistles*, 172.

With female deacons in view for verse 11, it is possible to explain the similar nature of the diaconal qualifications in verses 8 and 11 when viewed through gender-specific, stereotypical struggles.[^W-2-3a] Both verses begin similarly, calling both groups to be "worthy of respect." After this, each requirement is distinct to the gender yet analogous. Whereas women, who might struggle with gossip, are called to be "not malicious talkers," men are exhorted to be "sincere." Men, who might struggle with drunkenness, are enjoined to be "not indulging in much wine," while women are expected to be "temperate." Finally, men, who might find themselves in places of fiscal temptation, are called to "not [pursue] dishonest gain," while the women are exhorted to be "trustworthy in everything." Thus, Paul repeats himself in verse 11, not only to indicate that women are in view for the diaconate, but also to also communicate their qualifications in a specifically feminine context.

[^W-2-3a]: As mentioned above, Knight helpfully outlines the similarity between verse 8 and verse 11 (Knight, *The Pastoral Epistles*, 172).

Marshall points out that arguing for "women" to be translated as "wives of deacons" brings with it another problem: there is a "conspicuous lack of a reference to the wives of overseers."[^W-2-4a] Indeed, the diaconate qualification in verse 12, "a deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well," is equivalent to the elder’s familial qualifications in verse 2, he must be "faithful to his wife," and verse 4, "he must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him." Without verse 11, the familial requirements for a deacon and an elder are equivalent. Therefore, one must ask with Marshall, "Why should the wives of deacons, as opposed to overseers, need special qualifications?"[^W-2-4b] Mounce replies, "because a deacon presumably is more involved in activities such as visitation, it is more likely that his wife would be involved in his ministry than would the wife of an overseer."[^W-2-4c] Knight agrees that the qualification of the wife is especially important to male deacons because, "as spouses of the deacons they are to be involved with their husbands as their husbands seek to fulfill their diaconal service."[^W-2-4d] 

These answers insist that certain women ought to participate in diaconal ministry, but only in an unofficial capacity. However, Knight correctly asserts, "Whichever position is adopted as to whether women are to be ‘deaconesses,’ there is still consensus that women should be involved in ‘diaconal’ or service ministries in the church, whether they are elected as ‘deaconesses’ or not."[^W-2-4e] Granting that this spousal involvement would be equivalent to an unofficial female diaconate consisting of deacon’s wives, Walter Liefeld uniquely argues that the "women" in verse 11 are both the wives of deacons and official deaconesses themselves.[^W-2-4f] Liefeld sees the problem rightly: Paul surely had at least some kind of diaconal office in mind for these women, even if an assumed qualification for that office is being the wife of a current deacon. It seems odd for Paul to have expected women to participate in diaconal service while also barring them from the diaconal office. Regardless, the fact that wives of elders receive no special attention, while these women in verse 11 do, is strong evidence that Paul had in view women who were not merely the wives of deacons.

[^W-2-4a]: Marshall, 493. 

[^W-2-4b]: Ibid. In a footnote, he continues, "The positioning makes it impossible that the wives of both overseers and deacons are in mind."

[^W-2-4c]: Mounce, 204.

[^W-2-4d]: Knight, *The Pastoral Epistles*, 171.

[^W-2-4e]: George W. Knight, III, "The Family and the Church: How Should Biblical Manhood and Womanhood Work Out in Practice?" in *Recovering Biblical Manhood & Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism*, ed. John Piper and Wayne Grudem (Wheaton: Crossway, 1991), 354.

[^W-2-4f]: Liefeld, 134, 138.

The final argument for interpreting "women" as "female deacons" lies in the grammatical structure introducing each of the three groups in 1 Timothy 3:1--12 (elders, deacons, and women). "The Greek syntax distinguishes another group of church servants" in verse 11.[^W-2-5a] The identical opening phrase in verses 8 and 11 ("In the same way… are to be") compares and distinguishes the groups "deacons" and "women" from the "elder" introduced in verse 2.[^W-2-5b] However, as mentioned above, "the cursory nature of the qualifications and the lack of detail do not suggest that something so important as a church office is in mind."[^W-2-5c] Indeed, a new church office does not seem to be in view, but rather, a sub-group within a church office, namely, female deacons. The proper grouping of "women" within "deacon" is clearer when considered in the context of verses 12--13. Andreas Köstenberger articulates this argument best:

> Structurally, the presence of ὡσαύτως in 1 Timothy 3:8 and 11 ("likewise"/"in the same way") suggests that qualifications are given for two other types of officeholders besides that of overseer (3:1--7). To put it differently, the framing device by which 3:11 is sandwiched between 3:8--10 and 3:12--13 indicates that one large category is in mind, that of deacon, with Paul first addressing qualifications for male and then female office-holders, after which he briefly returns to male deacons and closes with a general statement pertaining to both.[^W-2-5d]

[^W-2-5a]: Utley, 47.

[^W-2-5b]: Knight, *The Pastoral Epistles*, 170. Towner agrees, "In similar parenetic contexts, the adverb ὡσαύτως that changes the topic to 'women'  serves to introduce a new but related case" (Towner, *The Letters to Timothy and Titus*, 266).

[^W-2-5c]: Marshall, 493.

[^W-2-5d]: Andreas J. Köstenberger, "Hermeneutical and Exegetical Challenges in Interpreting the Pastoral Epistles," Southern Baptist Journal of Theology 7, no. 3 (September 2003): 11.

In summary, the "women" in 1 Timothy 3:11 are members of the same diaconal office mentioned in verse 8. The qualifications listed for female deacons in verse 11 are a short, gender-specific repetition of the qualities specified in verse 8 for male deacons. Considering the evidence presented above, it is clear that the majority reading is correct: "women" should be interpreted as "female deacons."

# Additional Evidence

Now that the "women" in 1 Timothy 3:11 have been clearly cast as female deacons, there are two more passages to quickly consider as further evidence for this reading, namely, Philippians 1:1 and Romans 16:1. The argument for a single diaconate office is strengthened by Paul and Timothy’s greeting to the Philippians, "To all God’s holy people in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons" (Phil. 1:1 [NIV]). This introduction clearly supports a two-tiered structure of church offices. This language strongly militates against the existence of some third tier of deaconesses or female assistants.[^A-1-1a]

[^A-1-1a]: Köstenberger, 11.

In his salutation to the Roman church, Paul writes, "I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deacon of the church in Cenchreae" (Rom. 16:1 [NIV]). While some interpret this use of "deacon" to be an unofficial designation, such as "servant," Paul’s description of Phoebe seems titular: "Phoebe, a deacon of the church in Cenchreae." If this passage were taken in isolation, perhaps Phoebe’s role would be an enigma. However, in light of the above evidence, Towner is right to conclude that Paul’s address to Phoebe clearly "demonstrates both the existence of women deacons and the use of the masculine term to refer to a female deacon."[^A-1-1b] 

[^A-1-1b]: Towner, *The Letters to Timothy & Titus*, 266.

# Conclusion

Biblically grounded polity is essential for the health of the local church. The Scriptures clearly teach male elders leading the church with a subordinate diaconate serving the church. When a church has these two offices functioning properly, it is appropriate for women to serve alongside men within deacon ministry. This examination of Paul’s writings, most significantly 1 Timothy 3:11, clearly demonstrates that the New Testament model was for women to officially serve in the diaconate. Early church history shows that women were called to serve in such capacities as well. Even William Mounce, the strongest proponent of an all-male diaconate, hedges his position in his final analysis, writing, "Paul envisions, but does not require male deacons." [^C-1-1a] In fact, Paul envisioned something much more inclusive than a male diaconate; he envisioned a mixed-gender diaconate serving the church under the authority of the local elders.
