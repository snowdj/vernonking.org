Today was the last day of Crossover week, the culmination of much work done by our team, local churches, and many others this week. Many local churches in the area scheduled block parties and neighborhood events in order to make God famous in Baltimore. Our team joined Freedom church and a few others for a "Community Day" at Patterson Park (a giant park downtown). This event was intended to serve the community, let us tell others about Jesus, and provide connections specifically for a new church plant.

Although the event was sponsored by four local churches, the event was run by a group from rural Georgia. This team brought hundreds (!) of people and handled most of the logistics of the event. They took care of jump houses, t-shirts, free clothing, free lunches, free groceries, registrations, live music, and more. There were so many volunteers, our team had difficulty finding something helpful to accomplish. Thankfully, we ended up walking around helping register people, which gave the opportunity for gospel conversations.

My teammates, Ryan and Andrea Burris, and I had the opportunity to speak with Ashley as we attempted to register her and her friends. In speaking with her about our purpose for the event and asking her about her own church involvement, Ashley showed great interest in hearing the gospel message. In turn, my teammates and I spent a few minutes going through a spontaneous gospel presentation with her. During the entire conversation, Ashley was affirming what we were telling her and confessed to her own need for Jesus and salvation. 

Due to her eagerness, we asked if we could take some time to go through [The Story](http://viewthestory.com/10118) with her in detail. Ashley was eager and excited to sit down and go through the material. Over the course of about an hour, we went through The Story slowly and meticulously, expanding certain sections, and stopping often to clarify words and answer questions. Consistently, Ashley's questions were ones of clarification, rather than confrontation. Throughout our conversation with Ashley, she required no convincing—her heart, mind, and spirit were ripe for the harvest. Through much work by her Aunt and the work of the Holy Spirit, Ashley was prepared to receive the gospel message today with joy. Today, Ashley began her new life as a Christian.

Speaking with Ashley was a joy and a blessing. I had spent some hours this morning wondering how our presence at this over-staffed event could possibly matter. Praise God that he chose to use the Burrises and me as his instruments in winning Ashley into the kingdom.

This afternoon and evening, I have transitioned into SBC mode. I've moved from a dormitory on a university campus to a downtown hotel on the harbor. Although the accommodations are incredibly different, I pray I will continue to seek and find opportunities to share the love and message of Jesus with the City of Baltimore.
